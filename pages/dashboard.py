    This dashboard examines Reddit posts across various communities. The analysis tracks posting patterns and content characteristics to provide insights into user behavior and discussion trends.

    The dashboard includes post metrics, community statistics, and content analysis features such as topic classification and sentiment evaluation.

    The analysis covers:
    - **Time Patterns**: When misinformation appears and peaks
    - **Community Spread**: How content moves between subreddits,domains through crosspost
    - **User Engagement**: Reactions through votes and comments
    - **Content Analysis**: Language patterns and emotional tone
    - **Author Behavior**: Characteristics of users sharing unreliable content
